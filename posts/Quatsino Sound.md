A group of SISKA paddlers rented the Kagoagh Lodge in Hecate Cove in Quatsino Sound which is located at the Northern end of Vancouver Island. For those of you not from BC, Quatsino Sound is where the first three years of the TV show ?Alone? was filmed. We stayed in Port Hardy both going and coming and 4 nights at the lodge which is mostly used for sports fishing expeditions starting this week. There were 16 in our group and we filled every room plus did all of our own cooking.... The weather was outstanding, warm, sunny, calm seas and no wind right up until the day we headed back when we ran into some rough seas and strong winds. We first put in at Coal Harbour and paddled thru Quatsino Narrows and into Hecate Cove. We did day trips out of the lodge and returned to hot showers and wonderfully cooked group meals. On the way back we detoured into Marble River Canyon which was a treat. Great trip with good people.
