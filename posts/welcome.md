## Kayak Friendly tops 100 lodgings!

Woohoo Bonnie Henry says go and so do we. While following protocols and staying close to home, our KF team have diligently researched dozens more kayak accessible lodgings. So get paddling and get out on the ocean, where no masks are required and the only wave to think about is the salty kind.

Covid 19 caveat: Please be aware that although recreational travel in BC has been given the go ahead, some of the places on this website will reopen sooner than others. Some will make changes and may have to host fewer guests in order to be safe. Please check carefully with the individual operators when you're making trip plans. That said, what better way to support our local Vancouver Island kayak friendly places while having a wonderful time exploring our own beautiful ocean backyard.

## What is Kayak Friendly?

Kayak Friendly is the way to go kayaking from Vancouver Island and the Salish Sea in comfort and style. Our main goal is to make kayaking on multi-day trips more accessible to those who prefer not to camp. After much research a keen KF team of like-minded paddlers have identified more than 100 lodgings in various cabins, houses and B&Bs throughout southern coastal BC for paddlers to enjoy knowing that there will be a roof, beds, showers and a place to eat at the end of their paddling day. Of course this site works for canoeists too.

## How to use this website

Find an area that you'd like to explore on the map below then click on the kayak friendly places to stay that we've flagged for you. The link will take you to an information page designed for paddlers. From there you can contact the lodging  directly to make your booking. Some people may choose a route going from one lodging to another. Others may prefer to base at one place for day paddles.  Please note that we have researched locations for their kayak friendliness and done our best to provide accurate information. Beyond that you're on your own. We take no responsibility for what you might experience at the various locations. Though we would love to hear about your adventures via our blogs page.

Note: We expect kayakers and canoeists to be responsible for their own safety. Trip planners need to be aware of local tides, currents and weather conditions. Some areas may only be suitable for experienced and skilled paddlers. If you don't know, don't go.
