Covid 19 caveat: Please be aware that when travel in BC gets the green light, some of the places on this website will reopen sooner than others. Some will make changes and may have to host fewer guests in order to be safe. Please check carefully with the individual operators when you're making trip plans. That said, what better way to support our local Vancouver Island kayak friendly places while having a wonderful time exploring our own beautiful ocean backyard.

## About

Welcome to Kayak Friendly, the way to go kayaking from Vancouver Island and the Salish Sea in comfort and style.
For a few years we have envisioned making kayaking on multi day trips more accessible to those that do not wish to camp
in tents on beaches. After much research we have identified 40 plus lodgings in various cabins, houses and B&Bs
for you and your family or friends to enjoy during your trip. We're kayakers but canoeists could use this also.

How to use the website: Find an area that you'd like to explore on the map below then click on the kayak friendly places to stay that we've flagged for you. The link will take you to an information page designed for paddlers. From there you can contact the lodging  directly to make your booking.  

Note: We expect kayakers and canoeists to be responsible for their own safety. Trip planners need to be aware of local tides, currents and weather conditions. Some areas may only be suitable for experienced and skilled paddlers. If you don't know, don't go. 

## More Information

Now we want to hear from you. This site is a work in progress. We started with the Southern Gulf Islands and now we're working our way up and around Vancouver Island. If your property could be included or your information needs updating email Beth:   bethhaysom@shaw.ca
Paddlers please contact us if you know of a great place. Also send us short descriptions of your lodging and trip experiences and we'll post those as short blogs.
