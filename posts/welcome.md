Covid 19 Update: With Dr Bonnie Henry's blessing, paddling to kayakfriendly lodging is now possible for many of the locations listed on this website.  Where they are open, lodging hosts are doing everything they can to ensure their guests are safe. Now we can do our part by paddling in BC and supporting our local kayak friendly places. What better antidote to the coronavirus! So use this website to browse our listings; contact your chosen places to make sure they're operating, then plan a wonderful trip to enjoy our great outdoors.

## About

Welcome to Kayak Friendly, the way to go kayaking from Vancouver Island and the Salish Sea in comfort and style.
For a few years we have envisioned making kayaking on multi day trips more accessible to those that do not wish to camp
in tents on beaches. After much research we have identified 40 plus lodgings in various cabins, houses and B&Bs
for you and your family or friends to enjoy during your trip. We're kayakers but canoeists could use this also.

How to use the website: Find an area that you'd like to explore on the map below then click on the kayak friendly places to stay that we've flagged for you. The link will take you to an information page designed for paddlers. From there you can contact the lodging  directly to make your booking.  

Note: We expect kayakers and canoeists to be responsible for their own safety. Trip planners need to be aware of local tides, currents and weather conditions. Some areas may only be suitable for experienced and skilled paddlers. If you don't know, don't go. 

## More Information

Now we want to hear from you. This site is a work in progress. We started with the Southern Gulf Islands and now we're working our way up and around Vancouver Island. If your property could be included or your information needs updating email Beth:   bethhaysom@shaw.ca
Paddlers please contact us if you know of a great place. Also send us short descriptions of your lodging and trip experiences and we'll post those as short blogs.
