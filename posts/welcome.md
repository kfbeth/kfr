## About

For a few years we have envisioned making kayaking more accessible to those that do not wish to camp
in tents on beaches. We have spent many weeks identifying accommodation in multiple
cabins/houses/B&B's for you and your family or friends to enjoy during your trip. We're kayakers but canoeists could use this also.

Note: We expect kayakers and canoeists to be responsible for their own safety. Trip planners need to be aware of local tides, currents and weather conditions. Some areas may only be suitable for experienced and skilled paddlers. If you don't know, don't go. 

## More Information

We are in the process of setting up this site. We started with the Southern Gulf Islands and now we're working our way up and around Vancouver Island. If your property could be included or your information needs updating email Beth:   bethhaysom@shaw.ca
Paddlers please contact us if you know of a great place. Also send us descriptions of your lodging and trip experiences and we'll post those as short blogs.
