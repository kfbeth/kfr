We took a 7-day tour with Powell River Sea Kayak (PRSK) to their Cabana Desolation Eco Lodge in 2017. We launched at the PRSK site in Okeover Arm and paddled to the resort site on Kinghorn Island. PRSK is well organized in all respects, and has good staff at both ends of the trip. We took our own kayaks and gear, but PRSK seemed to have good boats and gear for rent. 

The Lodge has been well designed and built. Most of the comments on TripAdvisor are true. Accommodations and food are excellent.The hot showers, happy hour beers, gourmet meals with packed lunches,and good coffee delivered to the cabana before breakfast were a real treat!

On the last day paddling we returned through the Copeland Islands Marine Provincial Park (a highlight of the trip) to Lund where the company picked us up and drove us and the kayaks back to their launch site facility where our vehicle had been parked.

Since we are used to kayaking the lower Gulf Islands area, the paddling in Desolation Sound has two disadvantages. The "beaches" are all sharp, large rock, even the Cabana beach. Secondly, the various islands are all multi-miles apart, so day paddling does not get you far when you have to return to the Cabana each night.
